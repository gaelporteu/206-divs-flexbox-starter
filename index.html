                Do you ever read back a draft of your writing and wonder what happened? Red-cheeked, you thought your draft was complete. You felt excited. Brimming with enthusiasm. You knew it … this was going to be superb. Probably your best-ever blog post. Yay! You poured yourself a beer, feeling elated with your success. Any minor editing and proofreading could wait until the next day. But, the next day … you feel disappointed. Your writing sounds bland. Your sentences seem to stutter. What can you do? How can you create a smooth and enjoyable reading experience? How can you make your content dazzle and dance?

                With a deep sigh, Helen Fields switches on her PC. Another Monday. Another article to write about leadership “Hasn’t everything been written already?” Helen checks her Twitter stream and answers a few emails. She doesn’t feel like writing. Not yet. She googles the word “leadership.” 756 million articles. Ouch. But still … Helen knows she can help, encourage, and inspire her readers. While sipping her green tea, she leafs through her notebook with article ideas. Nothing feels right. Everything feels bland. She doesn’t want to write a humdrum article. She doesn’t want to dump her ideas online. She wants to write with power, passion, and pizzazz. She wants to wake up her readers, electrify them with her words, and jump-start them to change the world. Why write if you can’t inspire change? Why write if people only skim your subheads before clicking away? How do you choose vivid words that make readers not only remember — but also love — your ideas?

                In this overcrowded online world, do you ever wonder why people would listen to your advice? I used to feel the same way. I didn’t understand why people would read my writing tips when the web is awash with writing advice from people more experienced, more knowledgeable, and more authoritative than me. Why would anyone listen to me? I’ve learned that mindset was flawed. When I learned how to write well, a new world opened up. I connected with people across the world. I built a thriving blog. People started listening to my advice — and more importantly, they acted on it. Can you make an impact with your words?
